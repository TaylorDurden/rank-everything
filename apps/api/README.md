# With-NestJs | API

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# Also works with NPM, YARN, BUN, ...
```

By default, your server will run at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 💡 API Documentation (Swagger)

This project uses Swagger for API documentation. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

You can use the Swagger UI to explore and test the available endpoints directly from your browser. Alternatively, you can use your favorite API platform like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

### Important Note 🚧

If you plan to `build` or `test` the app. Please make sure to build the `packages/*` first.
